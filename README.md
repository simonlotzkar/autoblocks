# AutoBlocks
## for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition by Wizards of the Coast.
<p>
This is a tool for dungeon and dragons (D&D) dungeon masters (DMs) to automate mechanics for non player characters (NPCs).
This does not simulate any form of map, it's intended to be used with an external one.
</p>

***With this application you can do the following:***
  - **simulate rolling any number of dice, with any number of sides, and with any modifier**
  - **view a list of statblocks by their names:**
    - *view statblock details*
    - *add custom statblocks*
    - *delete statblocks*
  - **view a list of NPCs by their names, groups, and hit points:**
    - *select an NPC with a group and view a list of the NPCs in that group*
    - *roll actions, initiatives, or ability checks*
    - *track and edit hit points*
    - *edit NPC groups*
<p>
I made this application because I'm a D&D DM and I think there is no other application like this one. While there are 
some other applications for automating rolls, most try to do automation and map simulation at the same time. I think 
it's better to keep them separate because some people like theatre of the mind (no maps), and some people prefer in 
person. This app allows the DM to only exclude repetitive simple rolls and hp management so they can focus on the rest
of the game. So in short, I made this for personal use, but also because I think it solves a problem in a unique way.
