# AutoBlocks
## for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition by Wizards of the Coast.
<p>
This is a tool for dungeon and dragons (D&D) dungeon masters (DMs) to automate mechanics for NPCs. This does not 
simulate any form of map, it's intended to be used with an external one.
</p>

- with this application you can do the following for NPCs:
  - **view and create statblocks**
  - **create characters from stablocks**
  - **autoroll for characters (initiative, actions, etc)**
  - **edit character hitpoints**
  - **group characters for multi rolls and multi hp edits**
- this application holds data such as *default monster statblocks*, but also allows the user to *enter custom entries 
and clone/edit existing ones*.
<p>
I made this application because I'm a D&D DM and combat is by far the slowest and most tedious part of play. There are 
some online tools for simulating combat, but most try to do automation and map simulation at the same time. I think 
it's better to keep them separate because some people like theatre of the mind (no maps), and some people prefer in 
person. This app allows those not playing online to automate mechanics at a large scale. So in short, I made this for 
personal use and any others who don't want online maps but want large scale automation.
